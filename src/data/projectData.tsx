        <span className='emphasise'>Gallery</span> is a MERN stack image sharing
        app using a Masonry grid layout to produce an image feed similar to
        Pinterest. It uses Cloudinary in a very rudimentary way to upload images
        whose URLs are stored in the MongoDB Atlas database. Fronted image
        processing is used to ensure that any image upload to Cloudinary is at
        the maximum resolution that the image might be needed, i.e. avatar
        images have a maximum height of 40px. Feed images are dynamically
        reduced to a maximum intrinsic width of 400px suitable for the dynamic
        column width used. Logged in users are able to upload their own images,
        make comments, like photos and delete their own photos.

          <span className='bold'>Alternative Routes</span> was my first experimentation utilising the GPT-3 API, which was fun and far simpler tham had anticipated. The app generates alternative station names for the London Underground based on user themes. Themes and generated names are stored in a MongoDB Atlas database where data is not linked to any user so any user of the app sees the collective result of all users.

        daily standups and retros, two-day sprints, pair-programming and PR
        reviews. We also used Trello for project management and GitHub for
        version control and collaboration. The project was built using Ruby and

        tables and one-to-many relationships. Apart from being our first group
        project, for much of the group it was a first venture into CSS which was
        not taught by Makers. We used RSpec for testing and achieved 100%
        coverage over 50 unit and integration tests. We used Git and GitHub for
        version control and Postman API testing.
